# hello-world
This is the first day of my new journey in creating a portfolio for myself.
I completed my Associates in Computer Support, and then completed my Bachelors in Information Management.
I continued on toward my Masters Degree and completed all courses in Database Management.  
Decided to add a few more classes and changed my major to Web Development.  I only have four more
classes left.  Now I need to gain experience through practice.  Hopefully Github and Free Code Camp
will help me build the experience and confidence I need to move forward in my career.
